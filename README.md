## Description
This project showcases my expertise in computer vision, Arduino programming, and Python integration, addressing the critical need for safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary objective of this project was to create a model for face mask detection using Python. Leveraging the power of OpenCV and TensorFlow, I trained a custom model to accurately detect whether individuals are wearing face masks. The model combines image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time detection and classification of faces with or without masks.

To ensure seamless communication between the Python application and Arduino, I implemented Pyfirmata, a Python library for interfacing with Arduino boards. Pyfirmata enabled smooth coordination between the face mask detection model and the physical components controlled by Arduino. To demonstrate the practical application of the face mask detection system, I integrated a door lock mechanism using servos controlled by Arduino. When a person without a mask is detected, the system triggers the servo motors to secure the door, preventing access. Conversely, when a person wearing a mask is identified, the servos unlock the door, allowing entry.

By combining face mask detection algorithms with Arduino-controlled servos, this system offers a reliable and efficient approach to enforcing mask-wearing policies in various settings. It can be easily deployed in entrances, access points, or any location requiring automated monitoring and control. It showcases my ability to develop innovative solutions that leverage the capabilities of both hardware (Arduino) and software (Python) platforms.

I am proud to contribute to the advancement of technology-driven safety solutions during challenging times. This project represents a significant achievement in leveraging emerging technologies to ensure the well-being of individuals and communities.
